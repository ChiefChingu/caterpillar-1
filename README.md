# Caterpillar Alarm - Milestone 1
Imagine the following scenarios.

A. This Spring you go out for a picknick with your friends. Unfortunately, you are not able to finish your sandwich, because you got a severe rash and sore and weepy eyes. Is it a food allergy? Or hay fever? No, it is the oak processionary (link to Wiki). They are a human irritant because of their venomous setae (hairs), which can cause skin irritation and even asthma.

B. This Spring you go out for a picknick with your friends. You check the location of the picknick on CaterpillarAlarm.com to see if it is safe to be there this afternoon. You see that there are several alerts of infected trees. You change the plan and pick an area where it is safe to be. You enjoy your sandwich and friends and only have a hangover to worry about (the next day that is).

What is the most likely scenario? Chances are that it will be scenario A. Why? Because scenario B does not exist, yetâ€¦

This milestone 1 project is the inception of Caterpillar.com, a place where you can help each other by adding alerts about infected trees.
