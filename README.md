# Caterpillar Alarm - Milestone 1
## Background
The oak processionary (Thaumetopoea processionea) is a moth whose caterpillars can be found in oak forests, where they feed on oak leaves, causing significant damage. They travel in nose-to-tail processions (hence their name). They are a human irritant because of their venomous setae (hairs), which can cause skin irritation and asthma.

Western European countries see an increase of the oak processionary which causes more and more damage to trees and illness of humans.

Caterpillar Alarm wants to help people by:

Warning them of infected trees in their area.
Giving the option to warn each other.
Informing them about prevention, symptoms and treatment.

In addition Caterpillar Alarm can help local governments by providing a platform for municipal service requests.

### Site - warning
Out of scope for the first two milestone projects. In these projects fake data will be used. Project 1 will have hard coded fake data. Project 2 will use Google Maps API, but no user saved alerts.

Caterpillar Alarm offers a map overview of infected trees in their area. Users can lookup alerts by:
Entering their zipcode
Scrolling the map manually

The map will show infected trees and healthy trees. When a user has an account it can receive notifications about alerts in his/her area (home area or location based area).

### Site - warn each other
Out of scope for the first two milestone projects. In these projects fake data will be used. Project 1 will have hard coded fake data. Project 2 will use Google Maps API, but no user saved alerts.

Users can add alerts to the map themselves. The alert can contain detailed information about the infection, whether a service request to the municipality is submitted, comments from other users, etc. Also, media can be included: pictures of the tree/infection.

### Site - Informing
Background information about the processionary with trusted sources is also part of Caterpillar Alarm.

### Site - local government assistance
Out of scope for the first two milestone projects.
Idea is that users can make an alert which is automatically routed to the right authority, so they can take action and remove the processionary.
